We have created a fully integrated system for Hotel Sobana Udawalawa, replacing their current system for our 2nd-year 2nd-semester ITP module. Implemented using 
MERN stack with REST API and several dependencies. Our main goal of this project was to replace all manual management with a fully automated online management 
system. This system contains functions such as customer reservation, front-office management, inventory management, room management, food management, employee
management, hall management, and bar management.
